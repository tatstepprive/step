recommended:
log_min_duration_statement =  1000 (1,000 means one second, as this value is in milliseconds) 
default 
#log_min_duration_statement = -1
================
recommended memory parameters:

shared_buffers=128MB (default)
Fix: give 15-25% of RAM (32G RAM - 8G shared_buffers)
f:  caching data

work_mem = 4MB
Fix: Total RAM * 0.25 / max_connections (4G is OK)
f: provides the amount of memory to be used by internal sort operations and hash tables before writing to temporary disk files. Sort operations are used for order by, distinct, and merge join operations. Hash tables are used in hash joins and hash based aggregation.

max_connections= 100 (default)
Fix: set higher

maintenance_work_mem = 64MB
Fix:  higher than work_mem, Total RAM * 0.05
f:  provides the maximum amount of memory to be used by maintenance operations like vacuum, create index, and alter table add foreign key operations.

effective_cache_size 
Fix: 50% of the machineâ€™s total RAM

Time issue between client (psql/pgAdmin/dbeaver/DataGrip) and db
