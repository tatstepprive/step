Master server=source db
Replica/standby server=target db

Replication reasons:
*High availability
*load balancing (read-write on master, read-only on replica)
*disaster recovery 
*data migration

Replica server (one or multiple):
*Warm standby (no connections are allowed from users)
*Hot standby  (read-only connections from users)

Replication types:
*Physical replication
  * file based log schipping
  * streaming replication
  * all databases included (all or none)
  * no possible between 2 diff major versions
  * no possible between 2 diff platforms (windows vs linux)
*Logical replication
  * data based (data objects and their changes)
  * table level is possible

Replication modes:
*Asynchronous
   * replication lag=replica is out of sync with master for certain duration
   * data loss when master is crashed
   * no waits on transactions, better performance
*Synchronous
   * transactions are complete when they are replicated (waits, lower performance)
   * no data loss when master is crashed

Replication models:
*Single Master Replication
   * 1 master and >=1 replica's
   * unidirectional (data flows from master to replica's)
   * replica data is read-only
*Multi Master Replication
   * >1 master 
   * bidirectional (data flows in both directions)
   * conflict resolution schemas employed
