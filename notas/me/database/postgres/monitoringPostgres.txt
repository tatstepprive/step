Postgres what needs to be monitored:
1 Queries/sql (throughput, latency, concurrency, load, errors
2 postgres server ( dml, ddl, logs, wait-time, users, objects, backups, replication)

Tasks:
1 Database monitoring (operators, dba)
2 Database administration (operators, dba)
3 Database development (dba, developers)
