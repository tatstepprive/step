#Aggregate functions vs Analytic functions
Aggregate functions:
  aggregate data from several rows into a single row, reduce the number of rows to one row, return one result per group. Needs GROUP BY for other columns not used in function as arg.
  (syntax: <func_name>(<column_name>)) 
  (ex: avg(), sum() etc)
Analytic functions: 
 operates on subset of rows, but do not reduce the number of rows returned by the query, NO need for GROUP BY.
 (syntax: <func_name>([args]) OVER (<analytic_clause>)) ; analytic_clause=( [query_partition_clause] order_by_clause [window_clause] )
 (ex: rank(salary) OVER (order by salary desc)
 (ex: avg(salary) OVER ()) Explaining: OVER () means over the full table, all rows
