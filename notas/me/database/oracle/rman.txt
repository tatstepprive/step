RMAN=Recovery manager (backup util)
Location: $ORACLE_HOME/bin/rman

Files backed up by RMAN:
 * spfile (=dynamic server parameters file)
 * control file (rman takes read-consistent snapshot and back it up)
 * data files
 * archive redo log files
 * backup set pieces

Files CAN NOT backed up by RMAN:
 * pfile (=static parameters file)
 * password file
 * online redo log files
 * oracle net configuration files
 * tempfiles
------------------------------
Channels=server processes of rman for backup and restore
 * type disk = read/write backup on disk 
 * type sbt_type = read/write on a tape device ( character devices /dev/st<nr>, /dev/nst<nr> nr=0,1...)
 * type sbt = same as sbt_type (SBT=System Backup on Tape)
Tip: sbt is not used for image copy.
Repository=metadata about backups=names and locations of the pieces (files) in backupset or image copies
          = stored in control file of  target db (and optionally in tables in catalog db)
Catalog db=optionally db, containts rman repository (=metadata about backups)
Target db=db to backup/restore/recover
Auxiliary db=optionally db created from a backup of target db
Tip: rman can connect target db, catalog db, auxiliary db
Fractured block=block is updated by DBWn when RMAN backup busy on it, useless in backup, rman detects and retry till block consistent
Tip: rman backup only written blocks=allocated to segment blocks=used blocks (space saving)
Tip: sessions per rman: 2 (default and pooling) + 1/channel. Default=connection rman to target db; Pooling=monitor rman state; PerChannel=execute backup
------------------------------
CTWR= Change Tracking Writer=Block change tracking for faster RMAN (additional background process)
    f: records the address of changed block in change tracking bitmap file (not enable by default) 
#Enable change tracking (has little perfomance overhead)
alter database enable block change tracking using file '/u01/app/oracle/oradaa/orcl/change_tracking.dbf';
#check change tracking file created
select * from v$block_change_tracking;
#check CTWR change tracking process started
select program from v$process where program like '%CTWR%';
------------------------------
Rman commands:
backup= create rman backup (backup set, compressed backup set, image copy)
copy=create rman image copy (deprecated, use backup command)
-----------------------------
#Parallel backup
* number of channels (allocate channel tn type disk; =>n times)
* number of backup set (files per set n; 
* number of input files (number of datafiles)
case1: min(channels, sets, files) => min(4,13,100) =>parallelism=4
4 channels
100 datafiles / 8=12 sets of 8 + 1 set of 5=13 sets
100 files

case2: min(channels, sets, files) => min(4,3,20) =>parallelism=3 (so 1 channel is not used)
4 channels
20 datafiles / 8=2 sets of 8 + 1 set of 4=3 sets
20 files

normally=1 channel reads 1 file.
multisection backup enabled=mutliple channels can read 1 (big) file (enable by adding 'section size <size>; where size=10g,2g etc')
-----------------------------
Rman scripts:
#Rman script for offline, full, whole backup (d%=db id, %s=backup set nr, %p=piece nr starting 1 for each backup set)
run {
shutdown immediate;
startup mount;
allocate channel d1 type disk;
backup as backupset database
format '/ora/backup/df_%d_%s_%p';
alter database open;
}
#Rman script for online, full, whole backup
run {
allocate channel d1 type disk;
backup as compressed backupset database;
}
#Rman script for fast online, full, whole backup 
run {
allocate channel d1 type disk;
allocate channel d2 type disk;
backup as compressed backupset filesperset 4 database;
}
#Rman script for fast online, full, whole backup with archivelog (and deleting archivelog because 'delete all input')                
run {
allocate channel d1 type disk;
allocate channel d2 type disk;
backup as compressed backupset filesperset 4 database;
backup as commpressed backupset archivelog all delete all input;
}
#Rman script for online backup tablespace
run {
allocate channel d2 type disk;
backup as compressed backupset format '/ora/backup/df__%d_%s_%p' tablespace my_tablespace;
}
#Rman script for online backup individual datafile (using unique datafile number or datafile name)
run {
allocate channel d2 type disk;
backup as compressed backupset datafile 4;
}
#Rman script for online backup archive log files in location and starting with 
run {
allocate channel d2 type disk;
backup as backupset archivelog like '/u01/archive1/arch_1%';
}
#Rman command for incremental level 0 backup (=staring point containing all changes)
backup as backupset incremental level 0 database;
#Rman command for incremental level 1 backup (=only blocks changed since level 0 or level 1: 0->1->1...)
#tip: if no level 0 backup, it will perform level 0 backup
backup as backupset incremental level 1 database;
#Rman command for incremental level 1 cumulative backup (=always since level 0, even if 1 exist in between 0->....->1)

#Rman command for IMAGE COPY (backups all datafiles and control file to FRA)
backup as copy database;
#Rman backup archive logs for IMAGE COPY (moves all archivelogs in FRA, because 'delete all input')
backup as copy archivelog all delete all input;

#Enable parallelism: multisectional backup (multiple channels read 1 big file exp: 200G / 2 channels=20 pieces generated 4 at same time)
run {
allocate channel d1 type disk;
allocate channel d2 type disk;
allocate channel d3 type disk;
allocate channel d4 type disk;
backup as comressed backupset datafile <datafile-unique-nr> section size 10g;
}

Tip: the script can saved as file off_full_w.rman/on_full_w.rman and executed as command: rman target sys/pass@orcl @off_full_w.rman
Tip: if backup failes, change fra size (alter database set db_recovery_file_dest_size=10G;)
Note: backupset database=all datafiles and controlfile
Note: filesperset=generates more output files (pieces) of backup (backup/restore is faster) (default 1)
Note: backupset archivelog all delete all input =all archivelog files backuped and removed from disk
