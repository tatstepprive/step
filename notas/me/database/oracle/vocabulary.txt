OLAP=online analytical processing
RAC=real application cluster
ASM=automatic storage management (own oracle volume manager of fs)
CDB=container database
PDB=pluggable database
IRP=insert row piece
URP=update row piece
DRP=delete row piece
SGA=system global area (one/instance)
PGA=program global area (one/server process established by client connection) (contains: Private SQL area, Session memory(UGA), SQL work area)(resides in server process)
UGA=user global area (resides in PGA in dedicated server env; resides in SGA in shared server env)
DBWn=database writer process (required) (n=number, max=32) (f: writes data from memory (data buffer cache) to data files on diks)
LGWR=log writer process (required) (f:writes from memory (redo log buffer) to redo log file on disk)
SCN=system change number
CKPT=checkpoint process (required) (f: ondependant of commits all modified data are written from memory to data files, this is triggered by CKPT process, which in turn makes the DBWn processes to write)
SMON=system monitor process (required) (f: performs instance recovery during restart of a failure)
PMON=process monitor (required) (f: monitors and cleans up user processes)
RECO=recoverer process (required)
ARC=archiver process (optional) (f: make a copy of redo log files)
MMON=manageability monitor (f: used for monitoring the db, raises alerts etc)
CJQo=job queue processes (f: responsible for running user jobs)
Jnnn=job queue processes (f: responsible for running user jobs)
ADR=automatic diagnostic repository
Dedicated Server Mode=new server process for each new client connection. UGA is in PGA. (there is enough memory on host to handle all these server processes, one process per client connect)
Shared Server Mode=shared >=1 dispatcher process(es), that will set client query in 1 shared request queue of SGA Large Pool, query is treated by limited pool of server processes,
response is set in response queue owned by dispatcher (1/dispatcher), he will send result to the client. UGA is in SGA. No server process per client connection. (little memory on host)
CFS=cluster file system (=fs installed on undependant shared hard disk, that is connected by multiple computers and used by multiple os on connected computers) 
SEQUEL=Structured English QUery Language (developed by IBM on Dr. E.F.Codd's paper 'A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks' in 1970)
SQL=Structured Query Language
SQL CTAS=sql for 'Create Table As Select'
LRU=Least Recently Used list f: to keep track the least used block and most used block and free up space according to it if needed
HWM=high water mark
OUI=oracle universal installer (launch OUI = ./runInstaller.sh)
DBUA=oracle database upgrade assistent (launch dbua = $ORACLE_HOME/bin/dbua
OLS=oracle label security f: filter user access to rows
EM=Enterprise Manager Database Control=db management util in db 10g/11g. Not available in 12c. $ORACLE_HOME/bin/emctl is not available in release 19c (emctl start dbconsole)
DE=Database Express= db management util in 12c
OEM=Oracle Database Express 12C=db management util in 12c (navigate to https://dbhost:emport/em (default emport=5500)) Works in IE, not chrome/firefox: asking flash plugin) Fixed in 19c
patch=patchset=self contained installable image include OUI
common privilege=granted to common users accross all containers
local privilege=granted to local/common users in single pdb
PCTFREE=percent free (reserved % of the block for row expansion)
chained row = row cut across 2 or more blocks (block 8KB and row 20KB, row takes 3 blocks)
migrated row = row changed his location because of growing (update from null or varchar2 variable length row). rowid is in original block and points to new block with row.
HCC=Hybrid Columnar Compression f: data compression
