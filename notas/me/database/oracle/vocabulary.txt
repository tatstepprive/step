DBMS=database management system
RDBMS=relational database management system
DDL=data definition language (create, drop etc)
DML=data manipulation language (insert, update, delete)
DCL=data control language (grant, revoke)
Pseudo column=column that behaves like table column that not stored in disk, the value of column can not be changed by insert, delete, update (ex: ROWNUM)
OLTP=online transaction processing
OLAP=online analytical processing
RAC=real application cluster
ASM=automatic storage management (own oracle volume manager of fs)
CDB=container database
PDB=pluggable database
IRP=insert row piece
URP=update row piece
DRP=delete row piece
SGA=system global area (one/instance)
PGA=program global area (one/server process established by client connection) (contains: Private SQL area, Session memory(UGA), SQL work area)(resides in server process)
UGA=user global area (resides in PGA in dedicated server env; resides in SGA in shared server env)
DBWn=database writer process (required) (n=number, max=32) (f: writes data from memory (data buffer cache) to data files on diks)
LGWR=log writer process (required) (f:writes from memory (redo log buffer) to redo log file on disk)
SCN=system change number
CKPT=checkpoint process (required) (f: ondependant of commits all modified data are written from memory to data files, this is triggered by CKPT process, which in turn makes the DBWn processes to write)
SMON=system monitor process (required) (f: performs instance recovery during restart of a failure)
PMON=process monitor (required) (f: monitors and cleans up user processes)
RECO=recoverer process (required)
ARC=archiver process (optional) (f: make a copy of redo log files)
MMON=manageability monitor (f: used for monitoring the db, issuing alerts etc)
CJQo=job queue processes (f: responsible for running user jobs)
Jnnn=job queue processes (f: responsible for running user jobs)
ADR=automatic diagnostic repository
Dedicated Server Mode=new server process for each new client connection. UGA is in PGA. (there is enough memory on host to handle all these server processes, one process per client connect)
Shared Server Mode=shared >=1 dispatcher process(es), that will set client query in 1 shared request queue of SGA Large Pool, query is treated by limited pool of server processes,
response is set in response queue owned by dispatcher (1/dispatcher), he will send result to the client. UGA is in SGA. No server process per client connection. (little memory on host)
CFS=cluster file system (=fs installed on undependant shared hard disk, that is connected by multiple computers and used by multiple os on connected computers) 
SEQUEL=Structured English QUery Language (developed by IBM on Dr. E.F.Codd's paper 'A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks' in 1970)
SQL=Structured Query Language
SQL CTAS=sql for 'Create Table As Select'
