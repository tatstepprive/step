Backup types:
* Closed=cold=consistent=offline=db shut down/by rman db in mount mode (control file read required)
* Open=hot=inconsistent=online=db open (in use)=>archive mode required

* Whole=all data files and control files
* Partial=subset data files and control files=>archive mode required

* Full=all used blocks of the backuped files 
* Incremental=only changed used blocks since the last backup of the backuped files (better at time, space, db users impact)
             => incremental level 0 backup=starting point, contains all blocks
             => incremental level 1 backup=only changed blocks since last backup( level 0 or level 1 if exist (0-> 1-> 1-> 1-> ...)  
    * cumulative=all changed used blocks since the last full backup (since backup level 0)
    * differential=all changed used blocks since the last incremental backup

* User-managed backup=with os commands
* Server-managed backup=with rman commands
    * incremental backup

* Noarchivelog mode (default)
    * incremental backup
    * full
    * offline
* Archivelog mode (should be on prod)
    * incremental backup
    * full
    * offline
    * online
    * partial

* Logical (data pump export)
* Physical 
   * No archive log mode (cold backup, offline database)
   * Archive log mode
        * cold backup, offline database
        * hot backup, online database

Recommendation:
Monthly: closed, whole, full backup
Daily: open, whole, incremental backup
Every weekend: incremental level 0 backup
Daily: incremental level 1 backup

Used utils:
RMAN=Recovery manager (included in db)
External tools (commvault)

Backup types generated by RMAN:
* Backup set=contains several files and will NOT include blocks of a datafile that not currently part of a segment (=not include empty blocks)
            = logical structure with >=1 input files; 
            = physical output are >=1 pieces (=files)
     * full
     * incremental
* Compressed backup set=backup set that compressed
     * full
     * incremental
* Image copy= backup file is identical to the input file; (=byte-per-byte copy using oracle blocks 8K, not fs blocks 4K) 
            = immediate applycable, no extract from backup set needed (datafile, controlfile, archive log file)
     * full

Consistent datafile=every datablock is checkpointed (all changed blocks flushed to disk), file is closed by os.
                   = when db down after cleanly shutdown (=shutdown immediate/normal/transactional)
Inconsistent datafile=some blocks are copied in db buffer cache, updated, not yet written to disk, block on disk are out-of-date
                   = when db open or when db down after not clean shutdown (=shutdown abort)

Archival backup=backup you want to keep long term or forever (use in rman cmd: backup ... keep forever)
