Oracle data block

Database is set of tablespaces (System,Sysaux,Temp,Undo,Users)
Tablespace is set of segments
Segment is set of extents
Extent is set of oracle data blocks
Oracle data block (1block=8K) contains one or more rows (=row pieces)
One oracle data block has block header, free space, row data
#=========================================================
#Tablespaces 
* System f: used for core functionality, belong to sys schema
            auto created with db, can not be renamed or dropped
* Sysaux f: auxiliary(=help) tablespace to system tablespace,
            reduce the load or system tablespace, 
            auto created with db, can not be renamed or dropped
* Temp   f: storing global temp tables, sort and join operations
* Undo   f: used to rollback (=undo) changes in db,
            used by recovering db, when rollback statement used,
            provide read consistency
*Users   f: stores user objects and data, 
            default tablespace for all new users
All these tablespaces exist in cdb and pdbs.
#Types of tablespace
* Permanent  (system, sysaux, users) f: persistent schema objects
* Undo       (undo)                  f: manages undo data
* Temporary  (temp)                  f: objects for session duration
