1 How to create spfile if missing?
2 why connect as sysdba and no user sysdba in cdb_users, dba_users?
3 Diff between v$pdbs, v$container, v$services?
4 How often create pfile from spfile to be safe?
5 in pfile are more lines (no comment) then in v$system_parameter isdefault='FALSE', why?
6 Listener can have '0 handler(s) for the service' after dropping pdb. How to fix? 
6 RESP: restart listener after connect via ssh: lsnrctl stop; lsnrctl start
7 Why multiple listeners?
8 How long is listener running? When started?
8 RESP: lsnrctl status and see 'Uptime' and 'Start Date' columns.
9 Diff between dedicated and default server for listener configuration?
10 What will happen when user has role and we do revoke of some privileges given by role?
11 Meaning of role without sys privileges like select_catalog_role?
12 Why do we have refs to deleted tablespaces in dba_users? How to cleanup?
13 What is queue on database and how it works?
14 What are oracle managed files (OMF)?
14 RESP: OMF= oracle managed files are file for tablespaces where creation path and name can be given by database (unique),
the size and size extension are managed automatically by db, server alerts generation based on thresholds  etc 
14 RESP: OMF= oracle managed files, in dbca OMF are control file and redo logs
15 What is view for avialable calendars? (default 'Gregorian')
16 Temp tablespace recommended size? 
16 RESP: set workarea_size_policy=auto or use (alter tablespace temp shrink space  <-- this would disallocate not in use extents and would reduce size of Temp file on harddisk)
16 RESP:  50gb is the  recommended minimum size  for 11g
16 RESP:  how much of TEMP is used (select USED_BLOCKS*8192/1024/1024 "MB USED" , FREE_BLOCKS*8192/1024/1024 "MB FREE" from v$sort_segment where TABLESPACE_NAME='TEMP' )
16 RESP: Who is consuming the blocks of temp tablespace (
column username   format a10 
column user       format a10 
column tablespace format a20

select username,user,tablespace,blocks*8192/1024/1024 "Blocks USed",sql_id,session_addr,sqladdr from V$TEMPSEG_USAGE 
) ref: https://community.oracle.com/mosc/discussion/3480975/recommended-temp-tablespace-size
17 Show DBID?
17 RESP: connect with rman and see output: connected to target database: <dbname> (DBID=xxxxxxx where x=1-9)
17 RESP: select dbid from v$database; (DBID=xxxxxxx where x=1-9)
18 Database vs instance in oracle?
18 RESP: database is data on disk, instance is running db with memory SGA (=system global area) and background processes. Db mounted on instance, users connect to instance.
