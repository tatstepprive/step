16 RESP:  how much of TEMP is used (select USED_BLOCKS*8192/1024/1024 "MB USED" , FREE_BLOCKS*8192/1024/1024 "MB FREE" from v$sort_segment where TABLESPACE_NAME='TEMP' )
16 RESP: Who is consuming the blocks of temp tablespace (
column username   format a10 
column user       format a10 
column tablespace format a20

select username,user,tablespace,blocks*8192/1024/1024 "Blocks USed",sql_id,session_addr,sqladdr from V$TEMPSEG_USAGE 
) ref: https://community.oracle.com/mosc/discussion/3480975/recommended-temp-tablespace-size
17 Show DBID?
17 RESP: connect with rman and see output: connected to target database: <dbname> (DBID=xxxxxxx where x=1-9)
