1 Transactions will always block DDL (if using in other session, in same session it will terminate DML with commit/rollback on errors)
2 DDL are not user transactions, but implemented in DB as transactions with autocommit
3 In oracle db you can insert in table that you can not see (select)
4 In oracle db you can delete rows without see or update table. (p144)
5 one transaction = one or more DML statemens followed by commit or rollback (can affect meny rows on many tables, and takes hours to execute)
6 ACID=automicity, consistency, isolation, durability (ACI undo + redo, D redo)
7 incomplete transaction=uncommitted transaction; complete transaction=commited transaction
8 not possible to nest transactions in SQL, but possible in PL/SQL
9 DML (select, insert, update, delete, merge) DDL (create, alter, drop, truncate) DCL (grant, revoke)
10 TCS=transaction control statements (commit, rollback, savepoint)
11 commit=LGWR flushes log buffer to disk and flags transaction complete, DBWn does nothing
12 redo logs(LGWR) and data files(DBWn) contains committed and UNCOMMITED transactions (p150)
13 redo logs contains changes applied to data and undo segments
14 autocommit=implicit commit (DDL; in sqlplus exit command;)
15 systimestamp - x/1440 => x means x min ago (24h*60min=1440min)
16 systimestamp - x/24   => x means x hours ago 
17 simple 'select' dont require any lock; 'select ... for update' does.  
18 in oracle db deadlocks are resolved automatically in 3 sec, other locks should be resolved manually 
19 root container CDB$ROOT can not have local users, only common users
