1 Transactions will always block DDL (if using in other session, in same session it will terminate DML with commit/rollback on errors)
2 DDL are not user transactions, but implemented in DB as transactions with autocommit
3 In oracle db you can insert in table that you can not see (select)
4 In oracle db you can delete rows without see or update table. (p144)
5 one transaction = one or more DML statemens followed by commit or rollback (can affect meny rows on many tables, and takes hours to execute)
6 ACID=automicity, consistency, isolation, durability (ACI undo + redo, D redo)
7 incomplete transaction=uncommitted transaction; complete transaction=commited transaction
8 not possible to nest transactions in SQL, but possible in PL/SQL
9 DML (select, insert, update, delete, merge) DDL (create, alter, drop, truncate) DCL (grant, revoke)
10 TCS=transaction control statements (commit, rollback, savepoint)
11 commit=LGWR flushes log buffer to disk and flags transaction complete, DBWn does nothing
12 redo logs(LGWR) and data files(DBWn) contains committed and UNCOMMITED transactions (p150)
13 redo logs contains changes applied to data and undo segments
14 autocommit=implicit commit (DDL; in sqlplus exit command;)
15 systimestamp - x/1440 => x means x min ago (24h*60min=1440min)
16 systimestamp - x/24   => x means x hours ago 
17 simple 'select' dont require any lock; 'select ... for update' does.  
18 in oracle db deadlocks are resolved automatically in 3 sec, other locks should be resolved manually 
19 root container CDB$ROOT can not have local users, only common users
20 critical datafiles in tbs: SYSTEM and UNDO
21 Ids: tablespace id=name;  segment id=owner.name;  extent id=segment_nr/file.block_nr;  block id=nr.datafile 
22 Many to many relationship between segment and datafile: S:D (n:n)
23 Row block relationship: 
    LitteRow:Block (n:1); 
    BigRow:Block (1:n);  
24 Procedures, views, sequences are not segments, but structures in dd (data dictionary)
25 Table/index/undo are segments
26 Table and segment relationship: 
    T:S (1:1); 
    T:S (n:1) cluster: many tables in one segment
    T:S (1:n) partitioned table: each partion=segment, table has many partions
    T:S (1:0) deferred_segment_creation: table without segment:  table is empty and segment is not added because of parameter (deferred=later)
    T:S (0:1) nested table: table is column in other table (not table self) and column is saved as segment
27 DB_BLOCK_SIZE is set at db creation and can never be changed (default 8KB, can vary 2KB to 16KB)
28 OS block 512 bytes on Windows (NTFS) and 1MB on Linux (ext3)
29 Table can be spread in many tablespaces if it's partitioned table (TBS:S (1:n) normally tbs has many segments, and one segment is in one tbs)
30 control file v$ views, data dictionary dba_ views
31 tablespace usage with alerts (dba_thresholds view) is not monitored for temp and undo tablespace 
32 tablespace growing is visible in dba_hist_tbspc_space_usage view
