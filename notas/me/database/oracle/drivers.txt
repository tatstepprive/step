Difference Between JDBC and ODBC
JDBC= Java Database Community
ODBC= Open Database Connectivity

ODBC is a standard Microsoft WindowsÂ® interface that enables communication between database management systems and applications typically written in C or C++.

JDBC is a standard interface that enables communication between database management systems and applications written in Oracle Java.

Flexibility: - ODBC is a windows-specific technology - JDBC is specific to Java, and is therefore supported on whatever OS supports Java

Language: - ODBC is procedural and language independent - JDBC is object oriented and language dependent (specific to java).

Heavy load: - JDBC is faster - ODBC is slower
