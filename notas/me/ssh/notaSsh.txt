Create a key:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_sysadmin -C "sysadmin-key" -N ''
===================
Login in git and add id_rsa_sysadmin.pub in ssh keys of the user
======================
Entry in .ssh/config:
Host sys
  HostName <hostname.domain>
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_sysadmin
  LogLevel DEBUG3
  PubkeyAuthentication yes
======================
Attention: no other entries before that will give conflict to this 
config like
Other key, this is way it's in comment now
Host *
#  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_other
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
======================
restart ssh after configuration:
sudo service ssh restart

======================
#this should work when login with user dev to clone sysadmin repo
git clone sys:sysadmin/config-dev-host.git
======================
If everything works set in comment log entry in /home/dev/.ssh/config to 
avoid a lot of outprint when executing git commands via cli:
#  LogLevel DEBUG3
======================

git config core.sshCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_example -F /dev/null"

git config core.sshCommand "ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_scriptura"

#to have entry in .git/config
[core]
...
sshCommand = ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_scriptura
